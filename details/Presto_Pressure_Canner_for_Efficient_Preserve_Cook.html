Its 23-quart capacity is perfect for handling large batches, saving me tons of time during harvest season. I especially appreciate that it's the only canning method recommended as safe by the USDA for low-acid foods like vegetables, meats, and poultry. This gives me peace of mind knowing my preserves are safe and properly sealed.The build quality is excellent. The heavy-gauge aluminum construction ensures even heating, and it's surprisingly lightweight for its size. Plus, it works seamlessly on both my smooth-top and regular stovetop. The deluxe pressure dial gauge is a standout feature\u2014it\u2019s easy to read and ensures precise pressure control, which is crucial since I live at a higher altitude.I\u2019ve also used it as a boiling-water canner for jams and jellies, and it performs just as well. The included canning rack and the comprehensive 76-page instruction and recipe book are helpful for both beginners and seasoned canners.Overall, the Presto is durable, reliable, and versatile. Whether you're an experienced canner or just starting out, this is an excellent investment for preserving your food with confidence. Highly recommend!","purchase_model":"Style Name: 23 qt Canner   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-29 16:07:33"},{"user":"ANV Ohio","content":"I just received my unit and although I have not used the unit, I have read the book completely and called presto and they say there's no need to have the gauge checked. If it's new, it's ready go to, just follow the cleaning instructions on page 6 and 7 of the book. They also state there's no reason to buy another 15lb rocker because it comes with one. I ordered the extra rocker for $12 but the unit came last night and has a 15lb rocker in it. Pressure regulator would be the better more proper term, not rocker. I also work in the air pressure industry for a living and we rarely test our gauges unless something obvious is happening and we have variable testing at our facility that goes from 10psi to 300 psi, which that kind of pressure can be dangerous. So I'm not sure why people think they need to get their gauge tested. Even if the gauge is faulty, the rocker is going to rock at 15lbs and never let the pot get higher than this. Additionally, the books states there is a vent pipe (page4) is the \"primary pressure relief valve and will release pressure in excess of 15 pounds. The pressure regulator sits loosely on the vent pipe.\" That's a quote. So this unit is designed to be at 15 lbs or below which the pot can handle. I'm not sure why anyone would blow the lid off unless they rolled their rubber ring, their ring was old or not seated properly or the top was not locked. Again, I haven't used the unit yet, and will follow up soon with a review on that, but from my perspective, I'm going to can tomatoes over the next couple of days and that is 11 lbs of pressure which means I will need my gauge and my rocker should never rock. I have to play with the heat to find where my stove dial holds the pot at 11 lbs and make sure I never see the pressure regulator move or that means the pot has reached 15 lbs. ?? Some of these reviews were confusing and also caused me to buy a 15 lb regulator that came with the unit. It seems unnecessary. ?? Sure seems it's ready to go out of the box, no need to check or buy another item.Okay, I went home and used it last night. I have updates. First, this is a great unit. I can't imagine anyone blowing the lid off if you align it and lock it down. I filled it with water, put it on and ran it up to 15 lbs of pressure. On my stove it took 19 minutes to get there but that's going to vary. I think I understand why people suggest getting the variable weight. In my case, I can a lot of tomatoes. I need this at 10-11 pounds for 15 minutes. I either have to play with the heat setting on my stove to get it to stay at 10-11 pounds, while keeping an eye on it, OR if you buy the rocker weight that is 5-10-15 lbs, you can take it apart, make it a 10 lb rocker and just set it and forget it. I see the logic but don't think that makes buyin the other part necessary, it just saves a little time. Plus, for tomatoes, they suggest 11 lbs. If you are anal and want 11, the variable weight can't do that. if you don't mind 10-11 pounds, no big deal. Either way, I didn't take my cooker to have the gauge tested, This is ready to go out of the box. Just make sure and put a little oil on the ring to keep it in good shape and you might just want to have a back up ring on hand as the unit ages so that on that weekend you want to can, if the ring splits, you slide the new one in and keep going. Great unit and it's HUGE! I love it.Another update...this baby is getting a good workout. Canned a bunch of sauce last night, working on more as I type. We bought the additional weight/rocker that you can make 5-10-15 pounds. Put it at 10 pounds and let it pressure for 16 minutes. Gets the tomato sauce in the jars up to 240 degrees killing all that might be present. Great pressure canner. Highly recommend. Again, still don't understand how anyone could blow the lid off if you align this properly. No blown lids here. Just gotta read the book and use it properly I think.Another update - well, we've done 7 gallons of roma tomato sauce, 5 quarts a session and this pressure canner is great. It's so easy to lock the lid. I've also realized it has a special lock that when pressure starts to build, but even before it can be read on the gauge, the lock pops up and there's no way you can open this canner with pressure so no danger. I will say that when my 16 minutes at 11 lbs for tomato sauce are up, I take a kitchen knife and lean the pressure rocker over to let the steam out quickly. Within 4-5 minutes, all the pressure has bleed out, the lock goes back down and I take the lid off. This is not in the book, but I was just dying to see how the jars looks. As I took them out, they were still boiling and we put a laser temp gauge on them and they were reading 210-215. Given the heat was turned off over 4-5 minutes ago, it's reasonable to assume it was indeed up to 240 which is what is needed to kill all the stuff for tomato sauce. Keep in mind, this is different for every food, for every size and for every elevation. So read the book for your food and it will tell you what to do. I recommend citric acid as well as the adjustable pressure regulator (rocker) and a canning kit, particularly to get the jars out. Taking them out at 215 degrees is careful business. But it's cool to see them boiling inside the jars. And within 10 minutes, they are down to 160 which is when the 'tinning' or vacuming starts. As you know, the cooling is what causes the air tight seal, not the pressure canning. Pressure canning is to raise the temp up high enough to kill all the germs, when you take them out, they do the tinning sounds and you can hear all the tops going ting, ting.....ting...then you know you are getting a great seal!","purchase_model":"Style Name: 23 qt Canner   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-08-29 16:07:33"},{"user":"Cheyenne Ann","content":"I had a pressure canner many years ago. Bought it at a hardware store. No guage, but it did the job. Did I sell it at a yard sale? Don't know where it went, anyway.Decided recently to can again. So I read tons of reviews, Internet articles, compared features and prices. The Presto 1781 is the one I decided on. Amazon had it with free shipping, which made this doll the perfect deal for me.I have used it as a canner about 5 times already. Have not just pressure-cooked in it. Here are my observations: Easy to use. Follow the instructions in the book, and you are good to go. This baby is heavy! Moving it off the heat when it is full of jars is no small feat (especially when using as a boiling bath canner)! Eat a good breakfast! Half pint and pint jars stack nicely. I have not tried to can more than 7 quarts yet, so am not disappointed that the max is 7 quarts. I put up 7 qts of chili yesterday and my huge cookpot was pretty full. Any more would have been too much anyway.When using as a boiling bath canner, be careful when taking the jars out, especially when putting up half pint wide mouth jars, as the jar lifters are not very long and you can burn yourself getting that bottom set out. While you can use long tongs for half pints, I tried and ended up with a mess of hot strawberry jam all over and inbetween the stove and cabinet. So, use a jar lifter and hold it tightly!I like the guage on this canner. I have never used one with a guage before. After a couple of uses, I find I can take my eyes off it once it gets to correct pressure by the sound of the pressure regulator. It gets noisy when it gets too high. I live at 6800 feet altitude, and everything pressure canned has to be done at 14 lbs. 15 makes a noise and that's my signal to lower the heat.I have a ceramic top stove and have no issues with this canner on my stove top. The canner bottom is flat and heats up evenly.I love this canner. Just wish it folded up when not in use--it's a big honker!","purchase_model":"Style Name: 23 qt Canner   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2007-06-12 16:07:33"},{"user":"Aviator1","content":"This Presto is a very good pressure cooker.

I'm really glad I finally decided to push past that, because it turns out I love it. It was easy- in some ways easier than water bath canning, and is clearly very safe. I especially love the little silicone over pressure plug in the lid. It also seems impossible to put the lid on wrong, and everything is very well-made.The manual gives instructions for doing a \"dry run\" with a few cups of water and no jars, just to go through the process of bringing it up to pressure etc, and I definitely recommend doing that if you've never pressure canned before, it made me feel much more confident doing my first real batch. I've now done two batches, one of squash and one of half pumpkin half beans, and I have no complaints at all!I went back and forth on which size to get, particularly because we're a family of 2, I thought the larger might be overkill. Ended up going with the larger, 23 quart version, and very glad I did. When it first arrived I thought omg that's huuuuge, but when I actually started putting jars in it, it's not a ton of space. Plus if you want this to do double duty as a water bath canner, I think the 23 quart is a must. If you're struggling to fill the canner, you can put a few jars of filtered or distilled water in with your batch- makes for good emergency drinking water! Ultimately I think the larger size is more efficient, even for small families.Since this is my only pressure canner experience, I don't know how presto compares to other brands. However, this was very easy to use for a beginner, and in my opinion very reasonably priced for the value. I expect it will get lots of use, I will update if I run into any problems- but for now this thing is awesome!","purchase_model":"Style Name: 23 qt Canner   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-12-02 16:07:33"},{"user":"Kim","content":"Does a wonderful job. It's larger than I had expected. I read that the smaller one was not suitable for hot water bathing. That is true for quarts, but not for pints. I think, for the space savings in my cupboard, I would prefer the smaller one. Also, I feel the smaller one might reach pressure faster, saving a little bit of time. I don't generally do large batches. I have canned fruit, pie filling, broth, chicken, soups, stews, hamburger, stew meat, and veggies.We currently live at a high altitude and I only can at 15lbs. So the weight that comes with the canner is fine for now. When we move to a lower elevation I will invest in a 5-10-15lb weight because I prefer the jiggler to the pressure gauge.Update: We moved, I got the 5-10-15 weight. Works great!Overall, our family is expanding and this will do everything the smaller one will do and more, so I am satisfied with it and may appreciate the larger size later.Update: I decided to purchase the 16 quart. It fits in my cupboard. I know its a bit crazy to buy another one if the old one worked just fine, but I was annoyed and finally got the one I wanted.They both work perfectly and I have since purchased the 6 quart pressure cooker and absolutely love it for cooking. I used the 16 quart canner to reheat a rotisserie chicken and it turned out amazing and did it faster and better than the microwave and more moist than the oven.To sum up the capacity:The 23 Qt will hot water bath 7 quarts or 10 pints (stacking is not recommended for water bathing) andpressure can 7 quarts or 20 pints(double staked)the 16 Qt will hot water bath 10 pints (water bathing quarts is not recommended) andpressure can 7 quarts or 10 pintsThe 6 Qt is not recommended for canning, but makes dinners or sides very quick and easy.Also makes chicken stock in 20 min instead of hours of simmering. Then straight to my canner.","purchase_model":"Style Name: 23 qt Canner   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-01-25 16:07:33"},{"user":"Olivia","content":"I love this pressure cooker! It\u2019s big and holds a lot. The lid was a little hard to secure at first, and the first time I used it, I didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t on correctly, which ruined my batch\u2014but I figured it out. Also, small jars need extra attention, as the cooker requires a minimum of 12 cups of water regardless of jar size. This may cause water to get inside the jars, as it did with mine. Next time, I\u2019ll try placing foil over the tops of the jars to see if that helps.","purchase_model":"Style Name: 23 qt Canner   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-11 16:07:33"},{"user":"Yip I am one","content":"I gave 5 stars even though it didn't come with a middle rack.
