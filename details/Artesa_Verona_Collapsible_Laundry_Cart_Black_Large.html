Apparently they added packing stuffing and shipped only the one that I ordered, but in in a larger 2 allotted larger box, when I only ordered one at a time and at different datesâ€¦. All the extra effort of the disabled of moving extra cardboard and the consideration of wasted packing material, all matters. Come on, ship smart, and also ship green!Anyways, it is made of fairly sturdy tubular light steel, and once it is assembled, it really helps one carry their laundry to and fro to the washer etc. it is at a nice height and by using it to carry the laundry, one can maneuver it around very easily, as well due to the quality wheel assemblies that just screw into the bottoms with a one time use free wrench, thrown in as well. All in all, I would highly recommend this, and just maybe explain to the seller of any shipping needs, such as do not ship one in a larger heavier 2 allotted spaced box for only one order, for apparently they know not.

	var commentsList = [{"user":"Gumdlops Don't bother to waste your time very unrealistic plot line","content":"All I can say is where has this product been all my life. as the caption reads it's the best product I've ever bought from Amazon it's sturdy it's very nice looking the height is fantastic. I'm tall but on top of that I have a series back injury so bending over is a problem and this works in every way for me. I do like that it has the insert so that you can wash it. I also like that it has a bottom shelf that you can use to cut things from room to room if the basket's full I can see many uses for this. And the price given what I've seen on other similar items is great. So if you're on the fence about this item don't be. Lastly this was so easy to put together and again I have a back problem so lifting things for me isn't easy. I never even brought it into the house I said on my porch and I took it all apart I was sitting in a chair I put things on my lap The basket had one zip tie that I had to cut off if if you want to call that a problem then man that was a hassle cuz I just had an exacto knife so it wasn't easy. I think there might have been another zip tie on the bottom but that one had already been loosened so that came off very easily. The wheels just screwed in you just keep screwing and screwing till they tighten I never even used the wrench that they gave me I flipped it over there's locks on each side would lock the not the basket the whole thing the the bottom piece into place and then I just plunked the basket inside there's velcro around the edges of the basket insert and strings so you can tighten it. It was a breeze to put together and I had read other reviews that said they had a hard time. Absolutely no hard time and I'd be the first one to b**** about it I tell you. Great laundry cart!. I love it","purchase_model":"Color: Antique Black Color: Antique Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-03-04 16:07:38"},{"user":"Love2Read","content":"Sturdy.A little assembly, it was easy (tool included).It is heavy, but it\u2019s on wheels & easy to move.Update: first use, one of the insert that you screw the wheels into, bent and made the whole thing wobbly & hard to roll. Packing it back in the box to return was much much harder than putting it together.","purchase_model":"Color: Black Color: Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-03-12 16:07:38"},{"user":"Corliss Bryant","content":"One of the best things since slice bread.I love my basket.I call it my laundry buddy.It has made doing laundry so much easier.I have knee issues.Bending to pick up things off the floorisn't the easiest.I amover 60.This is high enough and low enough to easily roll your laundry to and from your machine.Folding clothes is easier keeping everything at a level that makes life easy.It rolls or and glides easily.It's far from an eyesore.It's so cute.I highly recommend.It will become your buddy also.A very good buy.Extremely easy to assemble.Basket and stand already assembled.It's a dream come true.I don't like doing laundry,but this has made it easier and a little fun.I highly recommend.","purchase_model":"Color: Antique Black Color: Antique Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-09-07 16:07:38"},{"user":"yanery","content":"WOW ABSOLUTELY EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS! Where do I begin?! The material is absolutely solid construction, the wheels, the metal, the assembly of the basket, the linen basket interior wrap- ITS ALL SUPERB! The ease to build and attention to detail is wonderful. For example, the interior lining folds down and has Velcro on both ends to keep it neatly folded over the top of the basket, can be tighten on one end to secure it further if you need, the wooden handle (perfect pop of natural wood), the locking wheels, the bottom basket locks in place, there\u2019s an additional side lock as well so the body stays in upright standing position. WOW they thought of everything when building this! It\u2019s much larger than I expected which I\u2019m absolutely pleased by because ill be using it to transfer loads from the dryer back inside my house so the size is perfect. I feel this can be used for many different things as well aside from laundry, be creative! I was definitely hesitant to buy it because of the price (I\u2019m always searching for a deal) but I must say, I\u2019m absolutely happy with my purchase and it\u2019s worth it!

I was looking for this for my mother who resides in a senior living facility. She alternates between using a cane and walker for mobility. The cart I wanted had to be higher off the ground so she wouldn't have to bend down constantly to scoop laundry out for the machine. I was also looking to find one that was wider so she could neatly place her folded clothes into. SCORE on this one!! I read some other reviews that read it was tricky to put together. This product was schedule to arrive later than I wanted (unbeknownst to me prior to ordering) with a notification of delivery of 5/6. I got a text on 4/20 from my mom that said, \"My laundry basket came and I'm putting it together.\" (!!) Less than 45 minutes later she had it together and it was ready to go. I must say, the finished product is worth more than 5 stars!! It is one \"classy\" (if a laundry basket could ever be considered that, lol) STURDY -(very important, especially for a senior with mobility issues) and the basket is removable and lovely enough to put directly on the floor to throw dirty laundry into. Well worth the price tag and I would most assuredly purchase this again.","purchase_model":"Color: Antique Black Color: Antique Black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2018-04-21 16:07:38"},{"user":"Mario Domanti","content":"Love this item.

Apparently they added packing stuffing and shipped only the one that I ordered, but in in a larger 2 allotted larger box, when I only ordered one at a time and at different dates\u2026. All the extra effort of the disabled of moving extra cardboard and the consideration of wasted packing material, all matters. Come on, ship smart, and also ship green!Anyways, it is made of fairly sturdy tubular light steel, and once it is assembled, it really helps one carry their laundry to and fro to the washer etc. it is at a nice height and by using it to carry the laundry, one can maneuver it around very easily, as well due to the quality wheel assemblies that just screw into the bottoms with a one time use free wrench, thrown in as well. All in all, I would highly recommend this, and just maybe explain to the seller of any shipping needs, such as do not ship one in a larger heavier 2 allotted spaced box for only one order, for apparently they know not.
