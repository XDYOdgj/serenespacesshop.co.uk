                                "reviewBody": "I was unhappy at first with the gauge not showing the exact pressure, as you might discover USDA guidelines changed recently to 11 pounds sea level for most meats, vegs, etc. You might also research that it's actually 10.5, but they rounded it up. The agency will always err on the side of caution, assuming everyone are idiots. But I'm pretty comfortable at sea level with the 10, though I personally like to do a 15 at 15 in the beginning, just for the be-sure-factor.At first I thought I could just buy a dial gauge with the usual numbers, and it would solve the issue, but I needed to can some beans so I used it. It took 20 minutes to pressurize. And it got to 3 no issue. I then understood that its not difficult to adapt to this, and honestly its not going to change anything, because the reality is the pressure will be regulated by your weight, right? And if you want to do the recommended 11 pounds, which weight are you putting on? Probably the 15 weight right, because 10 is not enough? So you're using a 15 weight and adjusting your heat to keep that dial at 11, right? In this unit it's almost the same, you set it at the 3, for 15 pounds and you would keep the heat high enough just to get slightly over that 2 mark on the gauge. It's not difficult. And who out there gets their canner to hit 11 steady the entire time without it going up or down as you keep adjusting your heat, because that's what you do, you spend a little time adjusting the heat until it finally stays steady on the number.Some reviews claim it won't reach high pressure, but it's not the cooker fault, its your heat probably is just not hot enough. Some home stove burners might not be big enough? Another other issue is there is an error in the listing and it claims its induction compatible, but it's all aluminum so no, it's not. No all aluminum is induction compatible unless you have an adapter plate. So I ordered that induction adapter plate so I can use it on my portable induction burner, because I have a glass top stove and wanted to use my portable induction. I found that it will work, except my portable just would not heat it enough to get it to pressure. Possibly full stoves that are induction would do it?The benefit of the 1,2,3 setting is you don't have that rocker noise, it's quiet. You never have a misplaced or lost weight to deal with. It's beautiful and I'm very happy with this canner, and I highly recommend it.I thought I would replace the gauge to test the truth of the 1 2,3 settings, but I contacted Tfal and found this canner is discontinued, you cannot buy a new gauge they said. And as the back of the threads are squared or flattened, unless you found one like that, you would have to drill a hole, as this hole is rectangle on this lid.",

	var commentsList = [{"user":"Chilehead Craig","content":"So, as we start off this New Year, we made eating healthier one of the top priorities (as I'm sure many have).What always seemed to throw a wrench into the plan is the amount of TIME it takes to prepare everything!Well I'm happy to announce that, for once, there is a way to work towards such a goal and actually save time!Its called pressure cooking!For those who know all about pressure cookers and are just looking for the operating pressures, I have good news for you!Unlike the previous version (the one with a red handle), the high pressure is now 14.5 psi and the low pressure is 10 psi per the manual.Previously, the max pressure was only 12 psi (low was 7 psi) and I know of at least one popular website that calls T-Fal out by name for having a lower than 'standard' 15 psi.I'd say 14.5 psi is pretty darn close!Theoretically, you should cook for 3.33% longer due to the 0.5 psi difference.That would be 1 minute for every 30 minutes.In reality, there are many other variables that make this negligible.Items that you cook for 30 minutes or more will usually have a larger time range anyway because of variables such as size and weight of the item (like a roast) and anything shorter than 30 minutes (most items) is a difference of literally seconds.I would be more concerned with the higher than 'standard' low pressure (as discussed further in my 'update' at the bottom).For the rest of you who are new to pressure cooking, I found this model very easy to use.I did not encounter issues that others comment about on other cookers like difficulty of opening and closing or not being able to get up to full pressure.Everything is very well made and seemed to operate very straight forward and smooth.I will say that, being my first pressure cooker, it did take a little getting use to.I did not really know what to expect, but, now that I know a little more about it, I will point out a few things that come to mind to hopefully help demystify it a little:- The manual says that for the first use, you should fill to the max line with water and cook at max pressure for 20 minutes and then do a quick release.I would do this as I think it helps to set up the valve.I say that because when heating up, the valve all of the sudden evacuated steam like a locomotive as if I had done a quick release, but I still had it set on the high setting.I was not expecting that so I immediately took it off the stove and ran cold water over the lid to cool it down.Upon inspection, the valve appeared OK, so I tried again.This time it gradually let some steam off and then maintained a lower stream that I would have expected the first time.I used it 4 times since and its gradual and operates as expected each time, so I think this was to somehow set it up.Either that or the valve was just stuck and some overpressure got it unstuck.Its still a good idea to do this to get familiar with it before actually trying to cook something.- The pressure indication pin is located in the hole on the handle and will not allow the unit to pressurize unless you have the latch locked.When there is pressure, the pin will raise up to be flush with the top of the handle and its red so you can see it easier.Note that this does not mean that you are up to your pressure setting.You must visually/audibly have steam coming out of the top of the valve.All the pin tells you is that the unit is still under pressure and you should not open it.- When you look at cook times, keep in mind that this is not the total time that you will be preparing an item.There is the time to reach full pressure and then the time to let it naturally release (if that's what the recipe calls for).So, for some black beans that I made, while the cook time was only 4-6 minutes, it took about 15 minutes to heat up and another 15 minutes to cool down.Granted, it would still take over 1 1/2 hours cooking them in an open pot, so I've still saved a ton of time and the beans turned out great!For a great list of cooking times for a variety of things, check out the Hip Pressure Cooking web page (google \"hip pressure cooking times\") which will give you a great place to start for so many different items.Miss Vickie also has a great site with a lot of information.As part of our resolution, we plan to cook a lot of beans.One side benefit that I discovered is that pressure cooking helps to deactivate the lectins in beans.Google lectins to read more about why you don't want to be consuming them, but it turns out that stove top cooking may not deactivate all of them and a slow cooker may not deactivate ANY of them!If you are a bean eater, pressure cooking is the way to go!To clarify what you will be getting, the pot and lid is as pictured except my valve knob is orange (the pic at the time of review shows grey).You will also receive a steaming basket and stand.As I learn more about this wonderful new kitchen gadget, I'll come back to update this review.If anyone has any great knowledge or resources that you want to share about pressure cooking, please leave me a comment.Thanks for reading and happy cooking!UPDATE 1:After using it a bit longer now, I've had a chance to try out the low pressure setting.This is best for vegetables and hard boiling eggs.When looking at cooking times for vegetables on 'low', they typically refer to a pressure of around 7-8 psi.With this low pressure setting being 10 psi, you should cook for a slightly shorter time (~20% less) so that your vegetables don't over cook since vegetables are particularly sensitive to cook times or they can become mushy.For doing eggs, I was concerned that 10 psi would be too high (on high setting of 15 psi, I've read the eggs could crack), but it turns out to work perfectly!I have never in my life pealed a boiled egg so easily!Just make sure there are no cracks already forming on any of the eggs.One of mine did, but I tried it anyway and it pushed the yolk out through the crack and it cooked to the outside of the shell!It was quite artistic, but not something I would eat.... haha!You should be able to fit a dozen eggs in the included basket, fill with water to below the basket (do not submerge), cook for 5 minutes and do a natural release.Back to more pressure cooking adventures!UPDATE 2:After 2 years of use (average once a week), its still going strong.Every now and then, I'll have to readjust the lid to get it to start pressurizing, but the gasket hasn't failed yet.In case you need to eventually replace the gasket, you can find it here:","purchase_model":"Size: 6.3 Quarts Size: 6.3 Quarts  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-01-06 16:07:33"},{"user":"Alfredo M","content":"This T-fal Clipso pressure cooker is amazing!

I have used it about 10-12 times. Plus i also use it for water bath canning with a regular lid from another pot i have. I could not love this purchase more! And would repurchase over and over but i have a feeling this one will last me a very long time!Update: I love this canner even more every time i use it! I wanted to add that this pressure canner is very quiet and easy to use! Most canners can be very noisy with the weight jiggles but this one does not have that. While the pressure is releasing ( to stay in range or to vent before beginning pressure) the air releasing can be noisy but nothing bothersome and that helps me to indicate if it needs attention. I was intimidated by pressure canning, and i am thrilled i bought this one! I now have a second more traditional one i found second hand for backup or additional space but this one is my absolute go to and i have suggested it to other canners in my community.

The only problem I have with this product is the difficulty in finding a quality replacement gasket. T-fal recommends replacing the gasket after a year or so. I have purchased replacement gaskets from the supplier of this pressure cooker on Amazon and I have never had a problem. However, the last gasket I purchased only lasted less than 3 months before it became ineffective. So currently, I am looking for a different supplier on Amazon that sells a better quality gasket. It seems that the quality of the replacement parts has diminished through the years. I don't know if it is T-fal that supplies the replacement gasket to the seller or if it is the seller that selects the gasket from another manufacturer.","purchase_model":"Size: 6.3 Quarts Size: 6.3 Quarts  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-28 16:07:33"},{"user":"Houston, TX","content":"I absolutely *love* this pressure cooker.It is quiet. It does the job. And after four years it still performs... every time!It is an \"old school\" pressure cooker. No electronics. But also no metal regulator that rattles.I have cooked soups, greens, stews, and whole meals with this thing.If you do not have a pressure cooker, you should get one. It will expand your cooking options.Some tips on using it:Once you get it up to pressure - that is, you have that constant \"whoosh\" of steam blowing out - turn it down! You only need a positive flow of steam. If it is just barely pushing steam out - that is where you want it.Understand that the \"regulator\" maintains the pressure within the pot. It is already at a boil if steam is escaping. Turning up the heat to make it blow a LOT of steam does not change what is going on within the pot. But it might end up scorching the bottom of the pot if you do so.Get it up to heat, and then turn it down to the point where steam is still escaping. That's all you need.Advise: Do not use russet potatoes in a pressure cooker - they will disappear or turn to mush. Rather, use the small round red or yellow potatoes. These will cook through and still be in one piece when you are done.If you have never used a pressure cooker before, try this:Put about three -four inches of water in the bottom. Dump in some seasoning - salt, pepper, garlic, sage, etc.Chop up an onion. Maybe some celery. Maybe some mushrooms. maybe some wine vinegar or wine.Chop up some carrots. Toss in some little red potatoes.Drop in frozen chicken parts -drumsticks, thighs, breast.Bring up to boil.Turn down the heat until it is *just* positive steam...Wait 30 minutes. Turn off heat.When the pressure drops - you can speed this up by putting it in the sink and running cold water over the pressure cooker - open it up.Take 3 tablespoons of corn starch. put it in an 8 oz glass. Add cold water and stir and mix.Add this to your pressure cooker. Bring it back up to a boil, uncovered. Stir until it thickens.Enjoy!","purchase_model":"Size: 6.3 Quarts Size: 6.3 Quarts  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-20 16:07:33"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"so far, this cooker has performed very well.it is a great addition to our kitchen gadgets.actually easier to use than the plug in variety","purchase_model":"Size: 8 Quarts Size: 8 Quarts  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-06 16:07:33"},{"user":"Richard Nali","content":"I was unhappy at first with the gauge not showing the exact pressure, as you might discover USDA guidelines changed recently to 11 pounds sea level for most meats, vegs, etc. You might also research that it's actually 10.5, but they rounded it up. The agency will always err on the side of caution, assuming everyone are idiots. But I'm pretty comfortable at sea level with the 10, though I personally like to do a 15 at 15 in the beginning, just for the be-sure-factor.At first I thought I could just buy a dial gauge with the usual numbers, and it would solve the issue, but I needed to can some beans so I used it. It took 20 minutes to pressurize. And it got to 3 no issue. I then understood that its not difficult to adapt to this, and honestly its not going to change anything, because the reality is the pressure will be regulated by your weight, right? And if you want to do the recommended 11 pounds, which weight are you putting on? Probably the 15 weight right, because 10 is not enough? So you're using a 15 weight and adjusting your heat to keep that dial at 11, right? In this unit it's almost the same, you set it at the 3, for 15 pounds and you would keep the heat high enough just to get slightly over that 2 mark on the gauge. It's not difficult. And who out there gets their canner to hit 11 steady the entire time without it going up or down as you keep adjusting your heat, because that's what you do, you spend a little time adjusting the heat until it finally stays steady on the number.Some reviews claim it won't reach high pressure, but it's not the cooker fault, its your heat probably is just not hot enough. Some home stove burners might not be big enough? Another other issue is there is an error in the listing and it claims its induction compatible, but it's all aluminum so no, it's not. No all aluminum is induction compatible unless you have an adapter plate. So I ordered that induction adapter plate so I can use it on my portable induction burner, because I have a glass top stove and wanted to use my portable induction. I found that it will work, except my portable just would not heat it enough to get it to pressure. Possibly full stoves that are induction would do it?The benefit of the 1,2,3 setting is you don't have that rocker noise, it's quiet. You never have a misplaced or lost weight to deal with. It's beautiful and I'm very happy with this canner, and I highly recommend it.I thought I would replace the gauge to test the truth of the 1 2,3 settings, but I contacted Tfal and found this canner is discontinued, you cannot buy a new gauge they said. And as the back of the threads are squared or flattened, unless you found one like that, you would have to drill a hole, as this hole is rectangle on this lid.","purchase_model":"Size: 22 Quarts Size: 22 Quarts  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-03-05 16:07:33"}];
