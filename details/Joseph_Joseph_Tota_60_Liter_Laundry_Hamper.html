	var commentsList = [{"user":"Kevin","content":"I love this hamper! It\u2019s very aesthetically pleasing and immediately makes the space feel more organized and calmer.Assembly:This package comes flats. I was very worried that the cloth sides would be flimsy but the way the assembly was designed ensures that you can stretch the fabric taut. Honestly think the assembly is very well designed. Although it can be challenging for some. Tip: I recommend using a credit card or similar to help tuck the fabric in the slot. It made my assembly process a breeze.Laundry bags:The bags are really easy to remove as they use Velcro around the plastic lip and it drops nicely into the hamper. It\u2019s a very satisfying drop.Tip: I use a separate net bag for my delicates and I\u2019m able to slip it around the lip to add another compartment.Other points:- Sturdiness: I think it\u2019s pretty sturdy for a fabric hamper that comes flat packed and can be easily disassembled. You can\u2019t compare this with one that is presassembled.- Price: It\u2019s really quite pricey but it was the look I wanted. I appreciated the thoughtfulness of the design so I believe it\u2019s worth the price. Although I did wait for prime deal to purchase it.","purchase_model":"Size: 90L Color: Ecru  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-11 16:07:37"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"This hamper is amazing! Super sleek, functional and sturdy. I hate the fabric hampers that seem to be theonly thing I can find anymore for the same price. Those are a rip off, this is definitely worth what you pay for. It's extremely satisfying to use and sleek in design AND actually stands up on its own. The fabric bags that the clothes go in are attached with velcro to the hard rings which makes them easy to remove to wash, but the velcro is sturdy so the bag stays put even when the bag is full for clothes. I do laundry at least once a week and haven't had any issues with running out of room with that amount of clothing, especially since there are 3 compartments. I've now purchased two of these, one for my husband and one for me. They are really fun to put together, which is strange because I almost didn't buy them since everyone seemed to be complaining about the assembly and not being able to get the fabric taut. The instructions are very clear and it comes with a QR code to a 5 minute video that goes over everything. I'm not sure why people were having so much trouble unless they did look at the instructions, because I watched it once through and assembled both hampers in 10 minutes with zero problems. They look just like the pictures in the listing with no baggyness or weird creases. Even without the video, I probably could have figured out how everything went together, it really isn't as complicated as people made it out to be. So don't be swayed by those reviews. Overall, very satisfied with these hampers, they were 100% worth the buy.","purchase_model":"Size: 90L Color: Ecru  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-12 16:07:37"},{"user":"Brandon Munoz","content":"Very nice looking light weight and sturdy laundry basket. Price is a bit steep but i had an amazon credit for $50 so that helped me justify the purchase.Instructions are a bit weird to follow but basically the trick is to sink the top and bottom pieces into the fabric so there is left over material at both ends. there is a small groove where you fold the stitched ends of the fabric into on both sides. once you get it started the rest folds into place pretty easily. After you go all the way around on both the top and bottom. All you need to do is use the included alen key to turn the screws inside the poles, this stretches the fabric and gives the piece a nice tight look. Then just put the rubber feet on and the lidTip: steam the fabric to get the creases out before you assemble for a nicer look.Have been using this for the past month and it makes doing laundry a breeze since i no longer have to dump my basket out and sort the clothes before i throw them in the washer :)","purchase_model":"Size: 90L Color: Ecru  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-04 16:07:37"},{"user":"Trisza Ray","content":"Laundry may never be glamorous, but the Joseph Joseph Tota 90-Liter Laundry Hamper makes it feel almost chic! If you\u2019re tired of juggling dirty clothes or having to separate whites and colors at the last minute, this hamper is about to become your new best friend.Why I Love ItFirst off, the sleek, modern design blends seamlessly with any room decor. It's a hamper that doesn\u2019t scream, \u201cHey, look at all the dirty laundry!\u201d Instead, it whispers, \u201cI\u2019m organized and fabulous.\u201d The neutral tones and minimalist aesthetic elevate it from a basic household item to a functional piece of decor.But it\u2019s not just a pretty face! The two removable washing bags with handles are a game-changer. Sorting laundry has never been easier. You can pre-separate your lights, darks, delicates, or even by family member\u2014no more sorting crises on laundry day! Plus, the bags are lightweight, sturdy, and super easy to carry straight to the washer.What Could Be Better?Honestly, I struggled to find any downsides. If I had to nitpick, I\u2019d say it might be too big for smaller spaces, but if you\u2019re a laundry enthusiast (yes, that\u2019s a thing), you\u2019ll make it work.Final Verdict10/10 recommend. It\u2019s the perfect mix of function and flair, and it might even make you look forward to laundry day. (Okay, maybe not, but it\u2019ll definitely make it easier!). I'm getting two more.","purchase_model":"Size: 90L Color: Ecru  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-19 16:07:37"},{"user":"jennifer","content":"Had this basket for about 3 weeks now and I don\u2019t regret it.

It\u2019s sturdy, and very luxurious. I timed how long it took me to put it together alone after taking it out of the box: 27 min from start to finish. Now, you can definitely go faster but I wanted it to be perfect looking and taut on the sides. I followed helpful tips from other reviews. Namely, when I slipped the bin cover over the rods, I pulled it over the plastic edges of the bottom enough so that after you can tuck in the lining of the cover into the plastic edge as shown in the manual. You do the same for the other end. Basically, you need to pull it so only the TRIM over hangs. The bin cover is perfectly cut and sewn such that the trim will tuck into one side, as well as the other end of the bin. After you tuck the liner into both ends of this bin you\u2019ll notice the cover is still kind of \u201cloose\u201d and looks a little sloppy. Have no fear. You get a hex key (little metal tool) that allows you to literally turn and tighten it in front of your very eyes. End result: perfectly tight and neat! Trust the process and take your time because if you avoid wrinkling the cover it\u2019ll look extra nice. I will be keeping white laundry, darks, and mixed in the 3 bins.","purchase_model":"Size: 90L Color: Ecru  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-27 16:07:37"},{"user":"Ben Amos","content":"I've wanted this hamper for a while now and had to get it when it went on sale.

Even when completely full, the bags are light weight and easy to move from the base to the washing machine. I love that it has a lid to keep my dogs from going sock shopping. The material doesn't have a plastic smell like other hampers.
