	var commentsList = [{"user":"Buffer","content":"Got the cart today and it took me all but an hour to put it together.I will be using it as a utility cart in my laundry area and will sit next to my washer.I live in a mobile home and have limited space.My laundry area is also the backdoor entrance into my home so I will be using the cart's bottom shelf to hold my flip-flops and/or shoes, slippers.Top shelf will hold the larger laundry detergent containers, 2nd shelf for smaller bottles of cleaning products and 3rd shelf for footwear.It appears to be quiet sturdy and easy to get in and out of the 12\" wide area.Actually, it has plenty of \"breathing\" room on either side with sufficient space for the wheels to rotate around for maneuvering.So if you've got a foot wide of space, you've got plenty of room.The locking wheels work well for keeping the unit stationary.There are suggested markings on the poles where to set the shelves.However, since there may be a possibility that I might use the second shelf for taller containers, I placed one of the large containers that I may be using on the 2nd shelf (as a measuring guide) before setting the top shelf in place.Make sure the rubber spacers are all at the same position on all 4 post before putting the shelves in place and the shelf lip or sides are all pointing upward.Those edges are what will keep your containers from falling off.I may be making this sound complicated, but it really isn't.You'll get the hang of it once you start putting the thing together.Bottom shelve goes on first.The instructions are simple to follow.Also the picture on the box is a good guide on how the cart is supposed to look.Remember, and the instructions do tell you this, that the post with the closed-off end is at the top.The other end is open for the casters to screw into.I did have to use a small rubber mallet to tap the shelves in place.You don't have to bang on the thing.Small gentle taps will do it.I'm a 76-year-old, female, that has limited strength in both hands, but hey, if I can do it, you can do it.Very, very sweet little cart!Small, mighty, and holds a lot!","purchase_model":"Size: 3-Tier Color: Chrome  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-05-11 16:07:39"},{"user":"MbakLisa","content":"This is perfect for my needs in the laundry room. It is strong and was easy to put together. The directions were clear. The shelves are adjustable, but all shelves can hold reasonably tall items. This is not as deep as the average washer, but I couldn\u2019t push my rack back against the wall, anyway, because of some pipes back there. So this depth and width and height was perfect for my space. It rolls, smoothly, and it doesn\u2019t wobble at all. It feels very sturdy. Very good value.","purchase_model":"Size: 3-Tier Color: Chrome  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-03 16:07:39"},{"user":"S.Hardwick","content":"Met my needs to fit in a very narrow space I opened up between my older washer & dryer. Rolls out so easily & holds a ton of spray bottles, laundry detergents, bleach, etc. Very sturdy. Would be great also in kitchen or bar, especially if space is limited.

It is recommended that the shelves be placed at pre-set increments, but they can easily be customized at one-inch intervals without compromising stability. I dropped the bottom shelf all the way to the bottom to accommodate threegallon-sized bottles of cleaners, and can still fit large detergent and fabric softener bottles on the second shelf. The top shelf is used for drier sheets etc but could still hold heavier items if I wanted it too. I assembled it easily within fifteen minutes by myself. It is very stable when assembled and the locking wheels are a nice touch. The only thing is the shelves cannot be assembled 'upside down' so the lip edge is facing downward thereby giving a flat shelf surface because the holes that the legs slide through are tapered to fit over the locking clips that snap around the legs to hold the shelves in place. This cannot be reversed as there would be nothing to hold the shelf in place if the locking clips are turned upside down because the large end of the clip that the shelf rests on would then be at the top and the skinnier end at the bottom, and the shelf just slips right down as there is nothing to hold it. But this wasn't an issue for me as I planned to use it with the lip as intended to keep stuff from falling off the shelves. All in all a great cart. I highly recommend it!","purchase_model":"Size: 3-Tier Color: Chrome  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-11-18 16:07:39"},{"user":"T. Nichols, careful shopper","content":"I recently broke my foot in an accident and unable to walk on it, using crutches.I was faced with many difficulties, one important one was getting food and dishes to the dinette table from the kitchen, and return of dirty dishes.Even getting a cup of coffee to the table or my recliner was impossible, walking on crutches.I began looking for a rolling cart that would fill this need and right away found this one on Amazon.I could not believe the low cost, and how it was exactly what I was looking for.I ordered it on a Monday night at 10:00 pm.I received it on the following Wednesday, 10 am.Less than two days!I couldn't believe how expensive carts of this type were now until I began searching onlne for one.Similar carts of this type cost over four times the price of this one on Amazon on any other site, and didn't include free shipping, as this one did.I couldn't find any that came anywhere near the low price Amazon had on this cart.I ordered it right away as I've never been dissatisfied with ANYTHING I ordered from Amazon, even on items that were necessary to return, the problem was always resolved quickly. With their customer service, I receive a live English speaking person anytime I called that were always able and eager to help me satisfactorily.Actually I expected a much lower quality of the cart than it really is.It is very heavy duty, and all chome parts that were nicely welded and finished beautifully.Even sitting in a chair in one position, I opened the box, packed very well, and had the cart put together in 10 minutes.I had even read all the customer reviews on the cart which were all positive.I learnead in one of the reviews that some particular parts (the four connecting joints of the legs) that were called for in the instructions, were actually already attached to one side of the part of the leg.The instructions did not indicate this and I was initially looking everywhere for the parts, thinking I would not get to use the cart right away after all.Then I remembered the review that told of this part already being connected to one side, and when I unwrapped the legs, it was indeed connected to that part.The cart is much heavier duty than I expected and very sturdy.The roller wheels were not like the much more expensive ones, but worked well for the cart.They were not rough on the eges as a couple of the reviews stated, and needed to be sanded down.(If this ever was a problem, it had already been corrected.) It serves my needs well and I'm extremely pleased with it, AND further pleased by the fast work on the part of Amazon.I ordered this around 10 pm, and had a reply about an hour later than the order had been fulfilled and was being shipped and gave the estimated delivery date, including the tracking number.I had the cart exactly on the date listed, even though I was almost sure it was over estimated!I know this ia a long article for one small cart. But I can't say enough about getting such a suprisingly good piece of merchandise so quickly with Amazon's usual fast service!I would reccommend the cart to anyone needing anything of this type.And I would always recommend ordering through Amazon, as I always feel safe and secure with them.I have already thought of uses for at least a couple more of the carts, and ordering them now that I've seen it.....computer room for scanner, printer, ect., laundry room, book shelves, etc. Thanks again, Amazon!","purchase_model":"Size: 3 Tier Color: Chrome  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2011-11-18 16:07:39"},{"user":"John Sch?ar","content":"It is seldom that we get a chance to use such a diverse piece of handy equipment and this Whitmor Supreme Cart is simply the most versatile helper I have found in years.It is well made, sturdy, easy to use and stores almost anywhere there is sufficient space.While just recently constructing a much larger shelf system that provided the opportunity to spout some awful words, this 'tool' (it really is like a tool) was a snap to put together.The instructions were adequate and with a little pre-reading and thoughtful re-reading of the instructions it came together in less than 30 minutes.It would have taken less time had I not had the assistance of our puppy inspecting each and every move while attempting to assist.(Before I forget let me remind anyone buying one of these that a key missing part of my instructions did not include 'listen for the click' or some other form of assistance when snapping two black shelf holders.It takes 8 shelf holders for each shelf and had I not placed a pair on each corner's indented part of the rail and did not hear that click when the holder was seated properly the shelf would not stay put.I wish I could have worded that better but then again I wish for other things that do not happen.Take the two black pieces and just fiddle with them on the rod and move it around until you hear the click.No click?Do not use until you hear it.The click is the key.Whew.Hush.)Because I wanted the locking wheels on the front of the cart, I placed a piece of bright tape so I only had one choice. It was somewhat embarassing to put the locking wheels on opposite corners.By now if anyone has read this far these are such minor comments they barely deserve space; however, if one person is assisted I'm happy just as I am with the cart.It is handy and useful or a combination of values that we seldom receive in one unit.I highly recommend this cart and will add to my Cart Kingdom with another one later.","purchase_model":"Size: 3 Tier Color: Chrome  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-10-15 16:07:39"},{"user":"Kula Girl","content":"Ordered this rack for an area with limited space.It fit perfectly in the laundry room.

I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about \u2026 YOU JUST NEED TO READ THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!!!!1) Be sure to start with \"caster end\" of the poles POINTED DOWNWARD AND ON THE FLOOR (you'll see holes with threads at one end and black caps at the other end \u2026 the holes with threads are for the casters and should be on the floor)2) Make sure the black shelf stops are pointed in the upward position when snapping onto the poles.They are marked with an UP ARROW \u2026 when snapping them on they should be pointed in the opposite direction of the caster end of the poles.The shelf stops are NOT supposed to snap together completely \u2026 once attached be sure to 'slide' each set until they fall into one of the grooves on the poles.AND BE SURE THAT YOU COUNT THE HASH MARKS ON THE POLES SO THAT EACH SET OF SHELF STOPS ARE SPACED THE SAME ON EACH POLE.3)Once you have your first set of black shelf stops snapped in at the bottom of each pole, position the bottom shelf with THE LIP OF THE SHELF POINTED UPWARD and slide the shelf down the legs.4) THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP \u2026. If you've done it all correctly that bottom shelf should slide down easily, almost completely covering the black shelf stops.If you still have a lot of black shelf stop showing (which I did) you've either attached the shelf stops upside down or your shelf is upside down.I have to admit I attached my first shelf upside down thinking that the lip of the shelf was to be pointed downward (as someone had previously complained because they were disappointed that the shelf lip had to be pointed downward in order to be assembled.They must have had the black shelf stops upside down).When I flipped the shelf over with the lip pointed toward the ceiling it slipped nicely onto the shelf stops.5) I used a rubber mallet (but a rubber soled, sturdy shoe will also work \u2026 don't use a regular hammer, you will dent your shelf) to bang the shelf into place to ensure the shelf was snuggly on the black shelf stops.6) Repeat steps #2-#5 for the middle shelf and then repeat #2-#5 again for the top shelf.7) Once completely assembled flip it upside down and very carefully screw the casters in, beginning by carefully grabbing the bold itself with your fingers and screwing it almost all the way in manually.Be careful not to strip the threads.If the bolts don't screw in easily don't force it or you'll strip the threads.Pull it out and start again.Once you have them screwed down to the leg bottom, the company provides a handy little wrench to do the last of the tightening.8)IF \u2026 you have the caster holes on the poles pointed down on the floor, the black shelf stops pointed up, and the shelf lip pointed up everything goes together smoothly.JUST TAKE THE TIME TO READ THE DIRECTIONS.It's sad that this product is getting some bad reviews \u2026 this was easy to assemble \u2026 you just have to take your time.Took me 20 minutes BY MYSELF.It even comes with an extra set of black shelf stops \u2026 just in case, but they weren't needed.If you find yourself struggle with this assembly YOU are doing something incorrectly.This is an awesome shelf!","purchase_model":"Size: 3-Tier Color: Chrome  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-05-05 16:07:39"},{"user":"Gramma","content":"This cart was easy to asssemble, fits into the available space perfectly.Does exactly what I wanted it for - storing the laundry supplies.Yay!","purchase_model":"Size: 3-Tier Color: Chrome  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-13 16:07:39"}];
