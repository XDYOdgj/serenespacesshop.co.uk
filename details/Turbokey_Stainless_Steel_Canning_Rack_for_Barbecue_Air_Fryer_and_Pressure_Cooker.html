Since this rack is 2 inches high with a 12-inch diameter, it was perfect for my use. I was able to cook between 16-18 bite size frozen chicken nuggets at 325F in 15 minutes. Also, cooked 4 frozen burger patties at 400F in 15-18 minutes, depending on personal preference. Be sure to place the rack on top of a 13-inch round pizza pan to catch any drippings.Cleaning the rack wasn't too bad. Let it cool completely to the touch, scrape off any stuck food bits with your fingernails, wash with a sponge soaked in dish soap, rinse thoroughly and dry with cloth towel. The total cleaning time was approximately 5 minutes +/-. Great rack and highly recommended.","purchase_model":"Size: Dia 12&#034;   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-05-28 16:07:33"},{"user":"D.
